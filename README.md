# QualityOptimization-PSO
Optimizing Cost of Quality in Manufacturing using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in MATLAB
In manufacturing, balancing quality and cost is crucial. Our project focused on optimizing the Cost of Quality (CoQ) using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in MATLAB.

ðŸ”¹ Problem:
High CoQ impacts efficiency and profitability. We aimed to minimize CoQ while maintaining high quality.

ðŸ”¹ Approach:
âœ… Defined an objective function to optimize quality vs. cost.
âœ… Used PSO in MATLAB to find the best process parameters.
âœ… Ran 1000+ iterations to achieve an optimal balance.

ðŸ”¹ Results:
ðŸ“‰ Reduced CoQ from $21,565 â†’ $21,535.
ðŸ“ˆ Improved Quality from 88.85% â†’ 89.92%.
âš¡ PSO outperformed Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion:
PSO is a powerful tool for improving cost efficiency and product quality in manufacturing.

This project strengthened my expertise in engineering optimization, computational analysis, and quality management, key skills for roles in manufacturing, operations, and R&D.
